The PoisFFT library solves the Poisson equation on a uniform Cartesian grid 
using the Fast Fourier Transform. It calls the library FFTW3 and (if MPI is used) 
also PFFT.

The installation is done using SConstruct. For compiling the library use

scons

or 

scons mpi=yes

in the `src` directory.

For compiling of the test programs add `test` after the above command.

If you use other compilers than GCC (gfortran, gcc, g++), add argument comp, i.e.,

scons comp=intel

or

scons comp=sun

For other compilers you vill have to add the options in the `SConstruct` file.

If you want to disable OpenMP, use

scons openmp=no

with MPI it disabled automatically due to the restrictions of PFFT.
